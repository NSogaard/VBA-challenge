# READ ME
## Code Sources
This week I only really got outside help from two sources.
1) This resource from the official Microsoft VBA documentation basically just helped me to understand how to format a while loop in VBA
    - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/whilewend-statement
2) This resource from StackOverflow helped to understand how to format cells through VBA
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42844778/vba-for-each-cell-in-range-format-as-percentage

## Code Location
- My VBS and Excel file for this project should be located in the same directory as this README file
- The images of the results for each quarter of the data should be located in the 'results-pics' folder, also located in the same directory as this README file

## Some Notes
- Instead of making it possible for the code to run on each sheet in an Excel doc individually, I instead made it so running the attached VBA script on any of the sheets in an Excel doc will complete the appropriate calculations and data generation for all of the sheets in that Excel doc.
